# Why I took this approach.

- I imagined that if I were to retrieve this data from the backend then the votes and anecdotes would be paired together as an object.
- Therefore I have made an array of objects so that it's clear how many votes there are for each anecdote

## Afterthought

I believe that if I did a simple array with the votes as suggested in the instructions instead of grouping it all as an object, I would have had a much easier time coding this project but I've learned a lot.
